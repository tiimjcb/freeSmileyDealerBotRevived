# ðŸ”’ Privacy Policy

## Introduction

The **Free Smiley Dealer Bot Revived** (FSD Revived) is committed to respecting the privacy of its users and complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This document outlines what data is collected, why it is collected, and how it is handled.

## Data Collected

FSD Revived collects **minimal data** strictly for operational and debugging purposes:

1. **Guild ID**  
   - Purpose: To identify which Discord server the bot is operating in, for logging and debugging purposes.
   - Storage: This is only logged temporarily in runtime logs.

2. **Usernames**  
   - Purpose: To display in logs who triggered a bot action (e.g., detected emoji). This helps identify issues or abuse.
   - Storage: Only stored temporarily in runtime logs.

3. **Detected Emojis**  
   - Purpose: To log what emojis the bot detected and processed.
   - Storage: Only stored temporarily in runtime logs.

## Data Usage

The collected data is **not shared**, **sold**, or **used for marketing purposes**. Its sole purpose is to:
- Debug issues with the bot.
- Provide transparency in logs for bot owners or administrators.

---

## Data Retention

- All logs are temporary and only exist while the bot is running.  
- No data is stored persistently in any database, file, or external service.

---

## User Rights

Since FSD Revived does not store any personal data persistently:
- You have the right to request that your data not be logged, but this will limit the bot's ability to operate effectively.
- If you believe the bot is logging data improperly, please report this via GitHub or to the bot's developers.

## Third Parties

FSD Revived does not share any data with third parties. However, as the bot operates on Discord, its behavior and interactions may be subject to Discord's [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
