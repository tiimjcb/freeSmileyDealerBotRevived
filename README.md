## 🌟 What is FSD Revived?

FSD Revived is a Discord bot inspired by the good old **Free Smiley Dealer Bot**, originally made by **Tomgrin10's**, which was unfortunately abandoned. This project gives a new life to the bot, keeping the spirit of cursed emojis alive. 

Every time an emoji is detected in a message, the bot will send back its corresponding free smiley face equivalent, if available.

It's chaotic. It's cursed. It's beautiful.
