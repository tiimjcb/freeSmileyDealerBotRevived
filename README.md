## 🌟 What is FSD Revived?

FSD Revived is a Discord bot inspired by the good old **Free Smiley Dealer Bot**, originally made by **Tomgrin10's**, which was unfortunately abandoned. This project gives a new life to the bot, keeping the spirit of cursed emojis alive. 

Every time an emoji is detected in a message, the bot will send back its corresponding free smiley face equivalent, if available.

It's chaotic. It's cursed. It's beautiful.


## 🛠 How to install it to your server? 

Simply click the installation link right here : 

It'll work right out of the box. Make sure you give it the permissions to read and send messages.


## ⚠️ Bugs and Known Issues

Due to the horrific process of importing all the smiley faces, ChatGPT was used to make it quicker. So, **bugs are expected**. 

Big thanks to @Squelchyman for helping me simplify this process.
