## üåü What is FSD Revived?

FSD Revived is a Discord bot inspired by the good old **Free Smiley Dealer Bot**, originally made by **Tomgrin10's**, which was unfortunately abandoned. This project gives a new life to the bot, keeping the spirit of cursed emojis alive. 

Every time an emoji is detected in a message, the bot will send back its corresponding free smiley face equivalent, if available.

It's chaotic. It's cursed. It's beautiful.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Bugs and Known Issues

There might be some bugs and issues with the bot, as it's my first Discord bot. Reach me on the support Discord server if you encounter any issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available features

The Free Smiley Dealer Bot Revived offers the following features:

### Emoji and Text Trigger Responses
- **Emojis triggers** : each time a supported emoji is detected (*more than 300*), it'll correct you with the corresponding free smiley.
- **Word triggers** : some words will trigger a response such as a GIF.
 
- **Is it friday?** : you can ask if it's friday, and the bot will answers depending on the current day!

All the triggers are set on a database ! You can submit your suggestions on the Discord ! üòÑ

### Experience System
You guys can gain experience across all servers by feeding the bot with paid smileys.
You can check your experience with the `/experience` command. And you can even ping a friend to see their experience too!

Moreover, there's a leaderboard on each server with the `/leaderboard` command.

For each emoji detected, you get 1 experience point, with a limit of 5 per message.

### Chat with Smiley
Have you ever wondered to chat with Free Smiley Dealer? Well, now you can!

You can start a chat session with the `/chat_start` command. The bot will respond to every message sent in the channel you started the chat in !

Each chat session is limited to *50 messages*, and can be maximum *5 minutes* long. You can start a chat session every *4 hours* per server. This is due to limitations with the Free Gemini API.

*Messages sent are not stored, but are used to enhance Gemini's AI. No personal data is linked to the messages. You can still opt-out and have your messages not sent to the API by using the `/ignore_me` command*

### Server Settings
