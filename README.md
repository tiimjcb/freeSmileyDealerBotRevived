## üåü What is FSD Revived?

FSD Revived is a Discord bot inspired by the good old **Free Smiley Dealer Bot**, originally made by **Tomgrin10's**, which was unfortunately abandoned. This project gives a new life to the bot, keeping the spirit of cursed emojis alive. 

Every time an emoji is detected in a message, the bot will send back its corresponding free smiley face equivalent, if available.

It's chaotic. It's cursed. It's beautiful.

It'll work right out of the box. Make sure you give it the permissions to read and send messages.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Bugs and Known Issues)

Due to the horrific process of importing all the smiley faces, ChatGPT was used to make it quicker. So, **bugs are expected**. 

Big thanks to @Squelchyman for helping me simplify this process.
